# Virtual-Cat
 The game of virtual cat allows the player to select a cat "Tabby, Ocelot, Tiger" and do some activities with them. However, as the player selects the options of feed, play or pet, the selected cat may do some random damage to the player. The damage is subtracted from the player's HP and once the HP reaches 0, it means the cat killed the player.
